## Overview
This individual statement provides a comprehensive overview of my contributions to the project. Each section details specific modules or features I worked on, relevant commits, and design decisions made during the implementation.
The following are my contributions:
* Wrote, tested and debugged the [ALU](path/to/ALU/file), [Register File](path/to/Regfile/file) and relevant MUXs
* Wrote, tested and debugged the [Cache](path/to/Cache/file)
* Assisted in debugging Single Cycle design
* Assisted in integrating data cache with the pipelined RISC-V CPU
* Responsible for maintaining Git Repo structure and writing README.md file
