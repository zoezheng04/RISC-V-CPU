## Quick Start
### Step 1: Clone the Repo
### Step 2: Configure vbuddy.cfg
Connect Vbuddy to your computer's USB port using a USB cable provided. Find out the name of the USB device used, and configure vbuddy.cfg (which contains the device name as the only line (terminated with CR))

Currently all the vbuddy.cfg files have the port number set as USB0. If this is not the case for yours, please change it accordingly!
